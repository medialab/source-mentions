# source-mentions
source project â€” analysing schenghen's events from actors mentions 

### Query the heurist database
Connect to heurist instance using login and password.

To get the data we need to ask for :

- **relationships** with **is mention by** as predicate (`type:1 field:6:5467`)
- **persons** and **events** (`t:10 or t:20`)

Complete query : `type:1 field:6:5467 or t:10 or t:20`

    We can the **control the data** using the connection tab who displays the query result as a network. A raw gexf can also be downloaded from there but the metadata form the relationships are missed during the export.

### export query as json 

- From the **Report** tab select the `JSON-mentions` as template. 
- The [template source code](./scripts/JSON-mentions.tpl ) can be edited to add new field to the report.
- You can **copy paste** the result from the preview or use the **report publication** helper to get the url of the JSON file.
